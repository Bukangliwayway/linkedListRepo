// NULL is just an indicator that the next pointer is non-existent, so don't be much bothered by that
// Global : stores variables
// Stack: stores functions and local variables
// Heap: Free memory

//Stack has 4 functions:
// Define: #include<stack>
// Declare: stack<data type> variable_name; //ex: stack<node *> list; 
//.push(data type)  //Adds new data into list/stack
//.pop()            //Clear the top of the stack
//.empty()          //Check if the stack still has top
//.top()            //Return the top of the stack
